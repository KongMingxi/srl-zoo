### Config files

#### Base config
Config common to all dataset can found in [configs/default.json](configs/default.json).

#### Dataset config
All dataset must be placed in the `data/` folder.
Each dataset should can contain a `dataset_config.json` file, an example can be found [here](configs/example_dataset_config.json).
This config file describes variables specifics to this dataset.


#### Experiment config
Experiment config file is generated by the `pipeline.py` script. An example can be found [here](configs/example_exp_config.json))

### Dataset Format

In order to use SRL methods on a dataset, this dataset must be preprocessed and formatted as in the [example dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=154qMJHgUnzk0J_Hxmr2jCnV1ipS7o1D5).
We recommend you downloading this example dataset to have a concrete and working example of what a preprocessed dataset looks like.

NOTE: If you use data generated with the [RL Repo](https://github.com/araffin/robotics-rl-srl), the dataset will be already preprocessed, so you don't need to bother about this step.

The dataset format is as followed:
0. You must provide a dataset config file (see previous section) that contains at least if the ground truth is the relative position or not
1. Image are grouped by episode in different folders (`record_{03d}/` folders)
2. At the root of the dataset folder, preprocessed_data.npz contains numpy arrays ('episode_starts', 'rewards', 'actions')
3. At the root of the dataset folder, ground_truth.npz contains numpy arrays ('button_positions', 'arm_states', 'images_path')

The exact format for each numpy array can be found in the example dataset (or in the [RL Repo](https://github.com/araffin/robotics-rl-srl)).

TODO: replace 'arm_states' with 'ground_truth' and 'button_positions' with 'target_positions'


### Launch script
Located [here](launch.sh), it is a shell script that launches multiple grid searches, train the baselines and call the report script.
You have to edit `$data_folder` and make sure of the parameters for knn evaluation before running it:
```
./launch.sh
```

### Pipeline Script
It learns state representations and evaluates them using knn-mse.

To generate data for Kuka and Mobile Robot environment, please see the RL repo: [https://github.com/araffin/robotics-rl-srl](https://github.com/araffin/robotics-rl-srl).

Baxter data used in the paper are not public yet. However you can generate new data using [Baxter Simulator](https://github.com/araffin/arm_scenario_simulator) and [Baxter Experiments](https://github.com/NataliaDiaz/arm_scenario_experiments)

### Learn a state representation

Usage:
```
python train.py [-h] [--epochs N] [--seed S] [--state-dim STATE_DIM]
                [-bs BATCH_SIZE] [--training-set-size TRAINING_SET_SIZE]
                [-lr LEARNING_RATE] [--l1-reg L1_REG] [--no-cuda] [--no-plots]
                [--model-type MODEL_TYPE] --data-folder DATA_FOLDER
                [--log-folder LOG_FOLDER] [--ref-prior]

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epochs N            number of epochs to train (default: 50)
  --seed S              random seed (default: 1)
  --state-dim STATE_DIM
                        state dimension (default: 2)
  -bs BATCH_SIZE, --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        batch_size (default: 256)
  --training-set-size TRAINING_SET_SIZE
                        Limit size of the training set (default: -1)
  -lr LEARNING_RATE, --learning-rate LEARNING_RATE
                        learning rate (default: 0.005)
  --l1-reg L1_REG       L1 regularization coeff (default: 0.0)
  --no-cuda             disables CUDA training
  --no-plots            disables plots
  --model-type MODEL_TYPE
                        Model architecture (default: "resnet")
  --data-folder DATA_FOLDER
                        Dataset folder
  --log-folder LOG_FOLDER
                        Folder within logs/ where the experiment model and
                        plots will be saved
  --ref-prior           Use Fixed Reference Point Prior
  --multi-view          Enable use of multiple camera (two)
  --no-priors           Disable use of priors - in case of triplet loss

```


Example:
```
python train.py --data-folder data/path/to/dataset
```

In case of `--multi-view` enabled make sure you set the global variable N_CHANNELS in file `preprocess.py` to 6
if `--model-type` is custom_cnn ( 9 if `triplet_cnn`).


### Multiple Cameras

#### Stacked observations

Using the `custom_cnn` architecture, it is possible to pass pairs of images from different views stacked along the channels' dimension i.e of dim (224,224,6).

To use this functionality to perform state representation learning with priors, enable `--multi-view` (see usage of script train.py),
and set the global variable N_CHANNELS in file `preprocess.py` to 6.


#### Triplets of observations

Using the `triplet_cnn` architecture, it is possible to learn representation of states using a dataset of triplets, i.e tuples made of an anchor, a positive and a negative observation.

The anchor and the positive observation are views of the scene at the same time step, but from different cameras.

The negative example is an image from the same camera as the anchor but at a different time step selected randomly among images in the same record.

In our case the TCN-like architecture is made of a pre-trained ResNet with an extra fully connected layer (embedding).

To use this functionality also enable `--multi-view`, preferably `--no-priors` (see usage of script train.py),
and set the global variable N_CHANNELS in file `preprocess.py` to 9 for training (3 otherwise).

### Evaluation and Plotting

### learned space visualization

To view the learned state and play with the latent space of a VAE, autoencoder or srl-priors, you may use:
```bash
python -m enjoy.enjoy_latent --log-dir logs/nameOfTheDataset/nameOfTheModel
```

#### Create a report
After a report you can create a csv report file using:
```
python evaluation/create_report.py -d logs/nameOfTheDataset/
```
#### Plot a learned representation
You can plot a learned representation with:
```
python plotting/representation_plot.py -i path/to/states_rewards.npz
```

You can also plot ground truth states with:
```
python plotting/representation_plot.py --data-folder path/to/datasetFolder/
```

To have a different color per episode, you have to pass `--data-folder` argument along with `--color-episode`.

#### Interactive Plot

You can have an interactive plot of a learned representation using:
```
python plotting/interactive_plot.py --data-folder path/to/datasetFolder/ -i path/to/states_rewards.npz
```
When you click on a state in the representation plot (left click for 2D, **right click for 3D plots**!), it shows the corresponding image along with the reward and the coordinates in the space.

Pass `--multi-view` as argument to visualize in case of multiple cameras.

You can also plot ground truth states when you don't specify a npz file:
```
python plotting/interactive_plot.py --data-folder path/to/datasetFolder/
```

#### Create a knn plot and compute KNN-MSE

Usage:
```
python plotting/knn_images.py [-h] --log-folder LOG_FOLDER
                     [--seed SEED] [-k N_NEIGHBORS] [-n N_SAMPLES]

KNN plot and KNN MSE

--log-folder LOG_FOLDER
                      Path to a log folder
--seed SEED           random seed (default: 1)
-k N_NEIGHBORS, --n-neighbors N_NEIGHBORS
                      Number of nearest neighbors (default: 5)
-n N_SAMPLES, --n-samples N_SAMPLES
                      Number of test samples (default: 10)
--multi-view          To deal with multi view data format

```

Example:
```
python plotting/knn_images.py --log-folder path/to/an/experiment/log/folder
```

### Baselines

Baseline models are saved in `logs/nameOfTheDataset/baselines/` folder.

#### Supervised learning

Example:
```
python -m baselines.supervised --data-folder path/to/data/folder
```

#### Autoencoder

Gaussian noise is added to the input with a factor `0.1`.

Example:
```
python -m baselines.autoencoder --data-folder path/to/data/folder --state-dim 3 --noise-factor 0.1
```

#### VAE

Example:
```
python -m baselines.vae --data-folder path/to/data/folder --state-dim 3
```

You can also designate the beta weight for the KL divergence:
```
python -m baselines.vae --data-folder path/to/data/folder --state-dim 3 --beta 1.0
```

#### PCA and t-SNE

NOTE: before applying t-SNE, a dimension reduction with `n_components=50` is applied for computational reasons.

PCA:
```
python -m baselines.pca_tsne --data-folder path/to/data/folder --state-dim 3 --method pca
```

t-SNE:
```
python -m baselines.pca_tsne --data-folder path/to/data/folder --state-dim 3 --method tsne
```

### SRL Server for Reinforcement Learning

This feature is currently experimental. It will launch a server that will learn a srl model and send a response to the RL client when  it is ready.
```
python server.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### CUDA out of memory error

1.  python train.py --data-folder data/staticButtonSimplest
```
RuntimeError: cuda runtime error (2) : out of memory at /b/wheel/pytorch-src/torch/lib/THC/generic/THCStorage.cu:66
```

SOLUTION 1: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES – Masking GPUs

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 Only Device 0 will be visible
NOTE: Do not set a device id superior to the number of GPU you have, or it will run on your CPU and may freeze your display.


SOLUTION 2: Decrease the batch size, e.g. 32-64 in GPUs with little memory. Warning: computing the priors might not work

SOLUTION 3: Use simple 2-layers neural network model
python train.py --data-folder data/staticButtonSimplest --model-type mlp
